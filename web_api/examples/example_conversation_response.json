    "content": "A pushup is a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and triceps, while also engaging the core and stabilizing muscles. To perform a pushup, you start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your body in a straight line from head to heels. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest nearly touches the ground, then push back up to the starting position. Pushups can be modified for different fitness levels by changing hand placement, elevating the feet, or performing them on the knees. They're great for building upper body strength and can be easily incorporated into any workout routine. \n\nIf you have more fitness-related questions, feel free to ask!",
